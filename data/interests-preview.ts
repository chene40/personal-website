    description: `Custom mechanical keyboards have been something that I've been interested for quite some time now. Not only 
	do you have the ability to design it however you like but you can also change how the keyboard sounds and feel. This has honestly 
	came a long way in helping me be more productive as it's satisfying to get more key strokes in. At the end of the day, you can finally
	say you built your own keyboard which suits you specifically! Click the "Learn More" button to view my keyboard collection and see the

	since then, I've decided to relive this passion and see the world through a different lens. I can confidently say that I'm not the best at
	photography haha - shaky hands and being color deficient does not really help ‚òπÔ∏è. Editing images isn't my forte either sadly... Nonetheless,
	exploring and snap shotting each moment in time places my mind in a state of tranquility. My personal favorite styles are portraits and bokehs!`,

	LEGO. You get all the pieces together and connect them with each other to make it work as a whole. When it comes to building PC, I really
	like aesthetic builds that can handle intensive processes. Something that I've been trying to get better at is managing my cables and overall

    description: `Apart from building things with my hands, sometimes I like to take it easy and immerse in a cozy environment and play some 
	games, read manga/webtoons or watch some short films (mostly animated). I play a variety of games but my favorite are typically RPGs 
	(action-rpg, ended country-life, turn-based strategy) - game that have a progressive storyline! I also find that reading and watching films
	helps a lot in disconnecting from the world and allow myself to gain inner peace so if you have suggestions, I'd love to hear them!`,
